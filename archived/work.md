sub_title1: About Me & Previous Research Experience


---


* My recent work gets people curious about neurocuriosity.

* I completed my PhD at the University of Birmingham. My doctoral research examined the neural mechanisms of object and action processing in patients with stroke and neurologically healthy individuals.

* I have a Master of Research degree in Cognitive Neuropsychology and extensive experience running cognitive assessment and working with patients with brain injury.

* I support and enjoy working in a collaborative environment.

And ...
* Having lived in different parts of the world, I sometimes miss the Aussie sun and food in Hong Kong but am happily pursuing dreams and opportunities in the UK at the moment.

* When I am not working, I am probably playing squash or climbing.

* I love karaoke although my friends think I would be better off not pursuing any careers involving singing.
