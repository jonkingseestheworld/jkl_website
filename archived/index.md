  Hi there, I am Johnny Lau. I am passionate about using an experimental testing and data-driven approach to address real-life questions. I have a keen interest in applied research, data science & tech innovation.
</p>

<p>
  I am research scientist. My work uses a combination of multiple techniques including experimental testing, statistical modelling, neuroimaging and machine learning to understand cognitive functions and impairments in human.

  My recent project at the University of Reading is concerned with understanding the mechanisms underlying how decisions are made and driven by rewards and motivation (like curiosity). 
  This work has recently been featured in <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/notebook/curiosity-and-hunger-are-driven-by-the-same-brain-regions-67992" target="_blank">The Scientist</a> magazine.
