      alt: curiosity_ggplots
    description: <i>Can curiosity kill the cat?</i> Using <b>(generalised) mixed-effects modelling, structural equation modelling</b> and <b>Bayesian inference</b>, this research project shows <u>similar cognitive-neural mechanisms underlying the driving force of curisosity and extrinsic instrumental rewards for risk-taking</u> (in a group of brain areas called the brain's reward networks). This work is published in the journal

Here are some projects of predictive models, interactive visuals, and cognitive science research that I have worked on recently.
