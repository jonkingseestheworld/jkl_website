  - title: POST-DECISION INFORMATION SEEKING
    image:

      alt: magnify
    description: Sometimes we want to know 'what if' after making a decision, even though knowing the alternative outcomes may make us feel bad. In this line of work, Lily FitzGibbon, Kou Murayama and I have examined the neural mechanisms underlying information seeking behaviours of this sort. The related publication is in progress.

  - title: OCEAN PLASTIC BAG IMAGE CLASSIFIER
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/2plastic.jpg
      alt: plastic
    description: I trained my first proper deep learning model and built a simple image classifier web app that identifies plastic bags in the sea with the help of FastAI.

  - title: MUSIC MATCH MAKER
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/spotify_phone.jpg
      alt: music
    description: I built a song analyzer and recommendation tool using Spotify listening histories and song feature data extracted from Kaggle. I based it on Random Forest, and tested other ML models too.

  - title: MOTIVATED RISKY DECISION-MAKING
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/ggplots.jpg
      alt: curiosity_ggplots
    description: In this project - a collaboration with Kou Murayama and other researchers in Japan - I demonstrated that decisions driven by curiosity share similar neural mechanisms as those motivated by instrumental rewards in a group of brain areas called the brain's reward network. This work has now been published in the journal
    link_info: 'Nature Human Behaviour.'

  - title: CORTICAL LESION FINDER
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/brainlesion.jpg
      alt: lesion
    description: In this ongoing project which started as a hackathon, we aimed to develop a free and open source voxel-based morphemetry solution to automate identification of epiletogenic lesions (using Python-based pipelines).

  - title: NEUROHACKMAP
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/hackmap.jpg
      alt: map
    description: In the summer of 2019 I participated in a two-week hackathon at the University of Washington, Seattle, and contributed to a code project which generates interactve visualizations of geospatial data related to the participants' career movements.

  - title: BRAIN ACTIVITY PATTERNS PREDICTED GAMBLE DECISIONS
    image:
      src: /assets/img/projects/mvpa_present.jpg
      alt: mvpa
    description: This side project used multivariate pattern analysis (incorporating Support Vector Classification/ Multiple Kernel Learning models) of brain activity patterns to predict people's gambling decisions. This work was presented at the Organization for Human Brain Mapping conference.

      alt: BCOS
    description: During my Masters and PhD study in Birmingham, I contributed to this line of large-scale clinical trials to develop and validate the assessment tools on post-stroke cognitive functions.
