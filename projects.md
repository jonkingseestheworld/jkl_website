      alt: DataVizCollection
    description: I enjoy designing and creating data visuals - for clients, as challenge contributions (e.g. '#TidyTuesday), and in my spare time. These graphics here are generated with a code-first approach and almost all of them do not involve any manual post-processing steps.

      alt: penguins
    description: Built with <b>R flexdashboard</b> and <b>Shiny</b>, this <b>interactive web dashboard</b> facilitates learning about different species of Antarctica penguins. Also, a demonstration of dynamic data visualisation of an open dataset.

      alt: music
    description: I developed a song analyzer and recommendation tool, based on Random Forest and tested with multiple other ML algorithms, using personal Spotify listening histories and song feature data acquired from Kaggle.

      alt: curiosity_ggplots
    description: <i>Can curiosity kill the cat?</i> Using <b>(generalised) mixed-effects modelling, structural equation modelling</b> and <b>Bayesian inference</b>, this research project shows <i>similar cognitive-neural mechanisms underlying the driving force of curisosity and extrinsic instrumental rewards for risk-taking</i> (in a group of brain areas called the brain's reward networks). This work is published in the journal

Here are some projects of predictive models, interactive visuals, and cognitive science research that I have worked on recently.
