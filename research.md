* My recent work gets people curious about neurocuriosity.

* I completed my PhD at the University of Birmingham. My doctoral research examined the neural mechanisms of object and action processing in patients with stroke and neurologically healthy individuals.

* I have a Master of Research degree in Cognitive Neuropsychology and extensive experience running cognitive assessment and working with patients with brain injury.

* I support and enjoy working in a collaborative environment.
