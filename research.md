sub_title1: My Research Interest and Experience


---


* My research and learning interests lie in analytic methods, behavioural research, and data science - with a focus on real world applications. 

* My previous research in cognitive science focused on identifying the brain mechanism that supports motivated decision-making behaviours. In a project with research findings published in the journal Human Nature Behaviour, we performed multiple experiments and modelling analyses, showing the common neural activities for risk-taking decisions driven by both curiosity and extrinsic rewards.

* I completed my doctoral degree (Cognitive Neuroscience) and an MRes degree (Cognitive Neuropsychology) at the University of Birmingham. My PhD research aimed at mapping the brain lesions related to cognitive impairments, particularly visual agnosia (deficits at object recognition) and apraxia (deficits at performing skilled movements and gestures) after stroke.
