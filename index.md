<p> I have a keen interest in applied research & tech innovation in healthcare, sustainable living, and human-machine interaction. 
</p>

<p> Currently, I am a data scientist in a telematics company, taking care of the statistical modelling & predictive analytics to detect vehicle accidents and battery health. I work on different stages of the ML operations - data management, feature engineering, model training & testing, and deployment to production.
</p>

<p> In my previous roles as a scientific researcher in the university, I ran and managed research studies investigating the human cognition and neural mechanisms using behavioural and brain imaging data. 
</p>


<p>
 When I am not working, I am probably having adventures - climbing, cycling, paddling, and walking in the woods.
</p>

<p> Thanks for stopping by.
